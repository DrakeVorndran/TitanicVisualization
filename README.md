# Titanic Visualization
This is a collection of various ways to visualize the titanic dataset.  


## About
The visualizations on the main page include bar graphs and a dot graph, as well as links to the other visualizations at the top.

The other pages Include a grouped visualization which is every datapoint styled in many different ways to show several properties in one graph.

The sorted visualization is many different graphs each with a different way of sorting and filtering data. Every datapoint displayed is styled off of the same guide, so you can see every property on every graph

The Interactive visualization can display several different types of data and can be sorted in different ways. You can also click on any data point to see more information about that passenger

## Background
I built this because I wanted to learn more about data visualization on the internet, this is just a testing project and isn't meant as anything serious.

If you would like to add visualizations, or change styles to make things look better, by all means go for it, I was trying to create visually distinct styles for the different data points, but I will admit that most of the time when there is more then one or two data points in the same graph, it starts looking messy rather then understandable.

## Getting Started
find it live [Here](https://drakevorndran.github.io/TitanicVisualization/)

If you want to work on this project yourself, you will need something that can spin up a live server, otherwise you will get a cors error. I recommend vs-code's live server add on, or the brackets live sever which comes built in.

Note, the links won't work because they are set up to work on github-pages.
